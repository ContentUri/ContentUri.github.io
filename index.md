## About

On Android, the best way to share content with other apps is via a [ContentProvider](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers). A `content://` URI is used to identify data in such a provider, hence the name of this site.

The goal of this website is to teach developers everything they need to know about handling data and files on Android.

*This is a work in progress. Currently there's nothing here to see* ðŸ˜ž

Get started by reading Google's documentation on [App data and files](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data).
